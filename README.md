# Image Classification
### MNIST using TFLearn
This project is based on MNIST dataset. Convolutional Neural Network with four layers was used to predict hand written numbers. Popular machine learning library TF Learn was used on top of TensorFlow. After training for the first time this program can save the model for testing in the future. So that while testing it does not need to train again. It can just load the previously trained model. 

### Database
The MNIST database of handwritten digits The dataset was downloaded from the built-in function. It can also be found from this [Link](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

### Database Properties
This database has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

### Dependencies
* Python 3.6.2
