# MNIST_TensorFlow_CNN-with-TFLearn

This project is based on MNIST dataset. Convolutional Neural Network with four layers was used to predict hand written numbers. Popular machine learning library TF Learn was used on top of TensorFlow.

After training for the first time this program can save the model for testing in the future. So that while testing it does not need to train again. It can just load the previously trained model.
